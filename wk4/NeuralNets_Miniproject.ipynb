    "An [\"Artificial\" Neural Network (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) is a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs. It is inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain. ANNs have generated a lot of excitement in the Machine Learning research and industry with great breakthroughs in the areas of speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing.  \n",

    "Neural neworks are typically organized in layers. Layers are made up of a number of interconnected **\"nodes\"** which contain an **\"activation function\"**. Patterns are presented to the network via the **\"input layer\"**, which passes through one or more **\"hidden layers\"** to be processed. The hidden layers then connects to an **\"output layer\"** to give the outputs. The image below shows the first and the simplest neural network, the so-called [feedforward neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network), wherein connections between the units do not form a cycle.  \n",

    "The basic unit in a neural network is the neuron, often called a \"node\" or \"unit\". It receives input from some other nodes, or from an external source and computes the output. Each input has an associated *weight (w)*, which is assigned based on its relative importance to other inputs. The node applies a non-linear activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs, as follows, $$f(w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_2 + b)$$. \n",
